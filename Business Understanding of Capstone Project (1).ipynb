    "The objective of this capstone project is split into 2 parts:\n",
    "1. Determine the probability of a traffic accident occuring given the conditions the car was driving in\n",
    "2. If a traffic accident does occur, determine the severity of the accident given the conditions the car was driving in\n",
    "\n",
    "This project could be helpful to multpile parties. Real-time mapping services could use this model to predict accident hotspots and give suitable recommendations to the drivers. Drivers who follow the recommendation could potentialy avoid a traffic accident, and could potentially avoid possible property and human damage costs. The roadway authorities determine the accident blackspots in the area and make the necessary changes. \n",
